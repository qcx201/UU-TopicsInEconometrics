# Topics in Econometrics: Replication Paper

This repository contains my replication project of Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011), henceforth AK.

I replicate AK's result on air quality regulations in the US using difference-in-differences (DiD) and regression discontinuity (RD) methods. However, finding AK's methodology unnecessarily complicated and lacking support of the identifying assumptions for causal inference, I re-examine their results compared to estimates from more standard DiD and RD implementations.
