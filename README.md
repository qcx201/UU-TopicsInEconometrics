# Topics in Econometrics

### Replication Paper

This repository contains my replication project of **Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011)**, henceforth **AK**. The replication is my term paper for the course **Topics in Econometrics** with Professor Adrian Adermon at Uppsala University.

I replicate AK's results on the causal effects of air quality regulations in the US using difference-in-differences (DiD) and regression discontinuity (RD) methods. Finding AK's methodology unnecessarily complicated, and the support of the identifying assumptions lacking, I re-examine their results with comparisons to estimates from more standard DiD and RD implementations.

### Files

* `Xie_2.do` is the stata code containing my own replication and analysis of AK.
* AK's dataset and replication package is available from the AEA webpage of the original paper.
