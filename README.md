# Topics in Econometrics

### Replication Paper

This repository contains my replication of **Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011)**, henceforth **AK**. The replication project is for my term paper in the course **Topics in Econometrics** with Professor Adrian Adermon at Uppsala University.

I replicate AK's results on the causal effects of air quality regulations in the U.S. using weather data and extensions of difference-in-differences (DD) and regression discontinuity (RD) methods.

I argue that the complexity of AK's DD and RD extensions threaten the validity of the causal identifying assumptions. Therefore, as a robustness check I compare their results to estimates using more standard DD and RD implementations.
