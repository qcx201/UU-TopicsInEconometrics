# Topics in Econometrics

### Replication Paper

This repository contains my replication project of **Auffhammer and Kellogg (2011)**, henceforth **AK**. The replication is my term paper for the course **Topics in Econometrics** with Professor Adrian Adermon at Uppsala University.

I replicate AK's results on the causal effects of air quality regulations in the U.S. using weather data and extensions on difference-in-differences (DiD) and regression discontinuity (RD) methods.

I argue that the complexity of AK's extensions on standard DiD and RD methodologies threatens the validity of the causal identifying assumptions. Thus, I re-examine their results with comparisons to estimates using more standard DiD and RD implementations.
